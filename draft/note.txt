Observation: records with linear fields may be split like environments.
No linearity in first round, only uniqueness.

Records captured by a closure must have (full) write permission or they must be readonly (i.e., there must be NO writers).
Inside the closure, captured records only have read permission so that every execution of the closure creates copies as needed.

Preliminary ideas for dealing with polymorphic types: count the number of uses of polymorphic data.
If it is used more than once, then its type should not be instantiated with write permission.

PT May 17:
A record update should avoid creating a recursive / cyclic data structure.
In this case, a copy should be enforced.
